# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1-5: January 8, 2019-January 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Practice with using Flexbox and Bootstrap by using them to code the same layout using one of each. Began working on a more complicated layout of a full homepage using Flexbox.

**Thoughts:** I have basic knowledge of HTML & CSS, but have never used Flexbox or Bootstrap before. I was able to achieve the layouts for exercises 1-4 by following the instruction and trial/error. Struggling a little more with excercise 5.
